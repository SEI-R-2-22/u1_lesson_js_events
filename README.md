# DOM EVENTS

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn all about DOM events and how we can use them. We'll also learn about callback functions and the power we can weild by using them.

## Lesson objectives

_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

1. Describe what a browser event is
1. Create a click event
1. Use a named, referenced function as the click handler for the listener

## Describe what a browser event is

Every kind of interactivity in the browser is an event: clicks, mouseovers, key presses, scrolling, resizing, loading the page, and more.

When you interact with the browser it checks to see if there is a _listener_ for that interaction.

If there is a _listener_ present, the browser will try to run any _handlers_ for those interactions.

A _handler_ is just a function that runs a desired procedure.

## Create a click event

How can we set up a _click_ event?

We need:

1. An element to set it on
2. A _listener_ that listens for the event: on _which element_ should the event take place
3. A _handler_ that runs the procedure we want to have happen when the event is triggered

Make a button in the html:

```html
<button id="btn">Click me<button></button></button>
```

Grab the button in the JS (DOM element):

```javascript
const btn = document.getElementById('btn')
console.log(btn)
```

### Event listener

Set an event listener:

Use `addEventListener()` [.addEventListener() documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/eventlistener)

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click')
```

The event listener takes a string as an argument. There are just a few strings that it will recognize as valid events, and 'click' is one of them.

[List of events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

### Event handler

Add a _function_ that runs what we want to have happen. This function is what _handles_ the event and is called an _event handler_:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Element clicked through function!')
})
```

Notice that we have supplied a function as an argument. The jargon for using a function as an argument to another function is `callback`.

Pseudocode for an event listener

```javascript
elem.on(STRING, CALLBACK)
```

### Add Text to the Page on Click

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.body.append('It seems as if it has been clicked!')
})
```

## Use a named, referenced function as the click handler for the listener

The _handler_ that we used for our click was _anonymous_. It was a function that had no name. We just told the listener to run an _anonymous_ function. We can give our function a name and thereby reuse that function with other event listeners.

### Named Function

We can abstract the anonymous function out and give it a name:

Separate function, not inside the listener:

```javascript
const addText = () => {
  document.body.append('It seems as if it has been clicked!')
}
```

We can then reference it in the event Listener:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click', addText)
```

With a named function, we can use the same handler for more than one DOM element.

### Referenced Function

Note that we do not invoke the function with parentheses. We do not want to invoke the function right away, we merely want to _reference_ it to be invoked when the listener runs it.

- The function should be defined before it is used in the event listener
- When the function is invoked inside the event listener **leave out the parentheses**. We do not want to invoke the function right away! We merely want to reference that function in the listener.

Here the function is invoked and will run immediately:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click', addText())
```

We don't want this! We only want the function to run when the user has clicked on the button.

Complete code:

```javascript
const btn = document.getElementById('btn')

const addText = () => {
  document.body.append('It seems as if it has been clicked!')
}

btn.addEventListener('click', addText)
```

Let's do something fancier, and toggle the background-color of the page using `.toggleClass()`

```javascript
const changeClass = () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle('black')
}

btn.addEventListener('click', changeClass)
```

CSS:

```css
.black {
  background-color: black;
}
```

## Lesson Recap

In this lesson, we learned all about event listeners and handlers and how we can leverage them. We also learned about the all-important callback function and hwo to use it.
